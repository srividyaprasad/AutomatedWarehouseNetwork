# Automated Warehouse Network design using Cisco Packet Tracer

Overview: Our project aims to automate warehouse management through innovative network design. 


By integrating Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, networking routers, and end devices, we create a real-time ecosystem prototype for monitoring optimal goods storage, warehouse environment maintenance and assembly processing. 

Autonomous forklifts, conveyor belts, and guided vehicles navigate efficiently via computer networks. Robust communication, security, and connectivity are central to our system, facilitated by wireless networks and a decision-making control system.

Key Features:
Visible real-time data exchange 
Utilisation of relevant communication protocols
Future-oriented warehouse demonstration
